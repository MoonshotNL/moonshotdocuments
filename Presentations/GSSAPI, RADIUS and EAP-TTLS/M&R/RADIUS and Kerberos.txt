RADIUS
	What does it do
	How does it work
	RADIUS+Kerberos
		Make a keytab file for the RADIUS server.
		Edit the /etc/raddb/modules/krb5 and users file. 
		Setup TTLS with PAP authentication in eap.conf. 
		Verify the paths to the SSL/TLS certificates and that the files are readable by the user under which the radius server runs.
		Edit the proxy.conf file. Take care to replace the secrets with the secrets you assign for local access and those you exchange with Eduroam. Easy to forget and a pain during debugging.
		Modify the 'inner-tunnel' and 'default' files under /etc/raddb/sites-available. Tell both of them to use the krb5 module for Kerberos Authorization
